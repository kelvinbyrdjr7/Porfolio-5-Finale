        Our affinity diagram organizes the ideas about improving crosswalk safety and timing   
        It breaks the problem into five categories (Who, What, Where, How, and Why) to indent
        It highlights walking students, runners, and off-campus residents who may often face   
        The solutions focus on  potential app and/or online tool that lets the users report.

        The app allows users to select a crosswalk location from a map, view its current crossing time, 
        and vote for their preferred duration. Users can also adjust and monitor crossing times in real time while walking, 
        then submit feedback once they’ve safely crossed. Additionally, the app collects and displays community votes for each intersection, 
        enabling better coordination and automatic adjustments to crossing signals based on real user data.
